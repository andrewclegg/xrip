xrip -- pull fields out of large XML documents efficiently.

Uses the XOM library (http://www.xom.nu/) via a Clojure wrapper (copied from https://github.com/marktriggs/xml-picker-seq).

To build (requires Maven 2):

mvn package

To run:

java -jar target/xrip.jar -h

xrip.jar is completely self-contained, including Clojure and everything else you need.

TODO

- filter by predicates
- namespace support
